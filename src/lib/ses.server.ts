/**
 * Email sending — now via Microsoft Graph (we moved off AWS SES).
 *
 * This module keeps its name and `sendEmail` signature so existing callers
 * (permits, visa exports, feedback, ShipSync, etc.) are unchanged; under the hood
 * it sends through Graph (/users/{sender}/sendMail) using the same app
 * registration as the SharePoint integration (Mail.Send permission required).
 * Sender defaults to MAIL_SENDER / the ticket sender (itsupport@jlsyachts.com).
